While it was stated in class, that we couldn't have defined testcases for this program, here are some of the words I tested.

toads
names
tears
rhino
spots
stump
faded
choke
state
slaps
array
roots
bumps
prick
jeans
and many many more on scrap paper I have lost.

I also reduced the number of attempts to test if running out of attempts printed the appropriate message.

By the way, the first word the program generated was "himbo".  Cathy was amused.
